# Introduction
This is a fork of a fork of the Mazda Connected Services integration originally written by bdr99 that has been packaged into a HACS compatible custom integration. The original code was part of the Home Assistant core integrations prior to a DMCA takedown notice issue by Mazda Motor Corporation.  It should restore all functionality previously available in the core integration.

# Installation

## With HACS

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Download the integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Manual
Copy the `mazda` directory, from `custom_components` in this repository,
and place it inside your Home Assistant Core installation's `custom_components` directory. Restart Home Assistant prior to moving on to the `Setup` section.

`Note`: If installing manually, in order to be alerted about new releases, you will need to subscribe to releases from this repository.

# Regarding the DMCA
I believe the DMCA takedown notice was issued in bad faith due to the following reasons:
- The DMCA refers to the functionality of the code, not the code itself, which is not protected by copyright laws.
- The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. set a precedent that copyright protected APIs can be used by third parties under the fair use doctrine.

I have no intention to comply with bad faith lawfare and hope that the continued existence of this integration helps to convince corporations to be more friendly towards developers and their community of users.
